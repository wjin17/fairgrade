  Unofficial Fairgrade Website
</h1>

This is a sample website for my NYU professor's company. This website was built with GatsbyJS, a static site generator that utilizes React.

## 🚀 Local development

1.  **Clone the repo**

    Get the project files from github

    ```shell
    git clone git https://github.com/wjin17/fairgrade.git
    ```

1.  **Install dependencies.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd fairgrade/
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Run the dev server.**

    From the project's root directory, run:

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Open the `fairgrade` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## Project organization?

    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├──── components

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that the project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`/src/components`**: This directory contains pieces of react code that compose the pages

4.  **`/src/pages`**: This directory contains the pages that the url will point to. For instance, http://localhost:8000/foo will point to /src/pages/foo.tsx

5.  **`/src/styles`**: Although this project relies heavily on tailwindcss, this directory contains some minor additions to the project styles

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

8.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

9.  Dont worry too much about the other crap that isn't listed.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

## 💫 Deploy

1.  **Ready to deploy the static files**

    Run the following command to build the static files to serve

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

1.  **The build files will be located in the build folder**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    #look in
    ./build
    ```
